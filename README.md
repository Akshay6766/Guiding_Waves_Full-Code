What problem are you going to solve?
Addressing the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals while swimming especially directional control,turns and flips,collision avoidance,etc

What are you going to build to solve this problem? How is it different from existing solutions? Why is it useful?
Utilizing an amalgamation of technologies, including cameras, sonar, gyroscopes, and various tracking sensors, my aim to develop an innovative Assistive Guidance belt that facilitates visually impaired individuals in swimming straight and collision-free. The proposed device ensures the swimmer's navigation by providing real-time auditory cues through a headset or a series of haptic vibrations.

Currently, prevalent solutions involve tapping on a helmet to signal swimmers upon nearing the pool's end, prompting them to reduce speed to avoid collisions. However, such methods lack any directional guidance during swimming.

By introducing the Assistive Guidance belt, my intend to revolutionize this scenario. This innovative belt combines the power of cameras, sonar, gyroscopes, and other tracking sensors to offer dynamic, real-time navigational support. As the swimmer progresses, the belt processes data from these sensors, allowing the device to determine the optimal course and provide immediate feedback.

Through auditory cues transmitted via a headset or haptic vibrations, the swimmer receives continuous orientation information. This eliminates the requirement for a second person to guide them and promotes an independent swimming experience. The Assistive Guidance belt goes beyond mere collision avoidance; it empowers visually impaired individuals to swim confidently in a straight line while being aware of their surroundings at all times.
